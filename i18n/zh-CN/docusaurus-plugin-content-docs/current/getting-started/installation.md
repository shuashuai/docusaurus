:::tip
If you are using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on Windows or Mac, docker-compose is already included. If you are using Linux, you will need to install docker-compose separately.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/answerdev/answer/main/docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -p answer -f - up
```

The default port for Answer is `9080`. You can access it at <http:>.

You can find all the available Docker images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/answerdev/answer/tags). The `latest` tag refers to the latest stable version of Answer.

```bash

### Step 2: Config database

:::tip
Answer supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite as the database backend. The smallest environment is SQLite, which does not require any additional configuration. If you want to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, you need to setup the database first and then configure the database connection in this step. Here we recommend using sqlite3 to complete your first experience.
