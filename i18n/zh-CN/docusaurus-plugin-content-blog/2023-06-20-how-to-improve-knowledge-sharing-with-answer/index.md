## What is Knowledge Sharing?

[Knowledge Sharing Comic by Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing)is an activity through which knowledge (namely, information, skills, or expertise) is exchanged among people, friends, peers, families, communities, or within or between organizations.

Answer is a platform for knowledge sharing, and the form of asking and answering is a natural way of knowledge sharing. The information in Answer can be documented for every user to check. Admins can modify them for keeping them up-to-date.

## 3 Types and Ways of Knowledge Sharing
01. Explicit Knowledge          
    Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc. Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence. ![Explicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing2.png)

02. Implicit Knowledge            
    The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and "know-how" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices. Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal. ![Implicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing3.png)

03. Tacit Knowledge                
    Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.   
    Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship. ![Tacit Knowledge](knowledgesharing4.png)
