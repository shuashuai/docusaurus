## What is Answer

Answer is a Q&A software which allows users to ask and answer questions about a particular topic or subject. It’s open-source, and everyone can access it freely. You can use it to build a platform in the form of Q&A. No matter a knowledge base, product forum, a support, Answer got it covered. ![Platforms built with Answer](everythingabtanswer1.png)

## Why Answer?

Recently, we noticed that B2B enterprises have been looking for solutions to build their own Q&A community or a corporate community. A dedicated section or subsection obviously cannot meet their needs because they request to customize content, have control over their data, rather than just “being a guest” in a public community.

That’s the moment we decided to build Answer — to help individuals, teams, and company at different scales to run their Q&A platform easily while have full control over their data.

## Why Answer is Open-source?

We’ve been longing to share our research and experience over the years in Q&A communities. The best way is to create an [open-source project](https://github.com/answerdev/answer) that is accessible to everyone. We have also made Answer website and plugins open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/answerdev).

## What is Answer built with?

Answer is mainly built Golang, and React.js.

## What license is the code under?

Apache-2.0 license.  
It’s a highly flexible, business-friendly, community-supportive, and easy-to-manage license.
